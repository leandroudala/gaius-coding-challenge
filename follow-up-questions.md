## Follow-up Questions

# How long did you spend on the test?
I spent 7 hours and 40 minutes.

# What would you add if you had more time?
I would divide this project to run in containers and developed an authentication based on JWT Security.

# How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?
It could be improved by implementing pagination and authentication with a token.

# What did you find most difficult?
I had troubles to calculate promotion discounts, so I spend a long time with tests.

# How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?
It helped to improve myself because I never developed an app to calculate promotional discounts. This kind of challenge involves several skills that a good developer should know how to handle.
